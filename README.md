## Born2beRoot: Comprehensive Guide to System Administration and Virtualization

### Introduction

The aim of Born2beRoot is to explore the fundamentals of **system administration** and **virtualization** by installing a **virtual machine** using VirtualBox. The objective is to create a server that adheres to a specific partition scheme as defined in the project. You have the choice of two Linux distributions: **Debian** or **Rocky Linux**.

This guide focuses on server configuration and does not include installation steps.

### Virtualization

#### What is a Virtual Machine?
A **Virtual Machine (VM)** is a software emulation of a computer system that mimics the architecture and functionality of a physical computer. VMs allow multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine by sharing its resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage. This approach enhances resource utilization, flexibility, and isolation for running different applications.

#### Advantages of a Virtual Machine
- **Resource Efficiency:** Run multiple OSes on one physical machine.
- **Isolation:** Issues in one VM donâ€™t affect others.
- **Flexibility:** Easy to create, modify, or delete.
- **Testing and Development:** Safe environment for experiments.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Quick backups and restoration.
- **Scalability:** Adjust resources as needed.
- **Cost Savings:** Reduces hardware costs.
- **Portability:** Migrate VMs across machines with ease.

#### Types of Virtualization
1. **Hardware Virtualization:**
   - "Bare metal" virtualization that emulates an entire computer system, including hardware components.
2. **Operating System Virtualization:**
   - Allows multiple isolated OS instances to share the same kernel. Common in container technologies like Docker.

### Logical Volume Management (LVM)

#### What is LVM?
**Logical Volume Management (LVM)** provides a flexible way to allocate disk space by abstracting physical storage into logical volumes. Unlike traditional partitions, LVM enables resizing, moving, and snapshotting of volumes.

#### LVM Components
1. **Physical Volumes (PVs):** Physical disks or partitions used by LVM.
2. **Volume Groups (VGs):** Pools of storage combining multiple PVs.
3. **Logical Volumes (LVs):** Flexible partitions created within VGs.
4. **Physical Extents (PEs):** The smallest unit of space in a PV.
5. **Snapshots:** Point-in-time copies of LVs.
6. **Striping:** Distributes data across multiple PVs for better performance.
7. **Mirroring:** Creates redundant copies of data.

#### Encryption
Encryption transforms readable data into an unreadable format to protect against unauthorized access. In LVM, encryption is typically implemented with **dm-crypt**, providing seamless block device encryption.

#### Benefits of Multiple Partitions
Partitioning enhances security, organization, and flexibility. For example:
- **Isolation:** Limits system disruptions if one partition fails.
- **Efficiency:** Organizes data into dedicated partitions (e.g., `/home`, `/var`).
- **Backup Flexibility:** Easier to back up specific partitions.

### Linux File System

#### What is a File System?
A file system manages how data is stored and retrieved on a storage device. It defines the structure of directories and files.

#### Types of File Systems
- **ext2, ext3, ext4:** Linux-native file systems, with ext4 offering enhanced speed and reliability.
- **FAT32, NTFS:** Windows-compatible file systems.
- **Swap:** Reserved for virtual memory.
- **JFS, XFS:** High-performance alternatives.

#### Directory Structure
- **/**: Root directory.
- **/bin, /sbin:** Essential system binaries.
- **/etc:** Configuration files.
- **/home:** User directories.
- **/var:** Variable data like logs.
- **/mnt, /media:** Mount points for external devices.

#### Mounting
Mounting attaches a file system to a directory, making it accessible. Use the `mount` command to specify the device and mount point.

### SUDO

#### What is SUDO?
`sudo` allows permitted users to execute commands with elevated privileges.

#### Installing SUDO
```bash
su
apt update && apt upgrade
apt install sudo
usermod -aG sudo <username>
```

#### Configuring SUDO
Add the following to `/etc/sudoers`:
```bash
Defaults passwd_tries=3
Defaults badpass_message="Wrong password. Try again!"
Defaults logfile="/var/log/sudo/sudo.log"
Defaults requiretty
```
